# Welcome to Nike Store!

The project consists of an e-commerce for the sale of football boots.


## Project details:
The website, consists of a home page, in which you can find a catalog of the boots to sell available. Also, entering the link to view product details, you can have more information about it with the possibility of adding them or not, to the shopping cart. 
On the other hand, the site contains five more components in the navigation bar, four of them refer to the four models of Nike boots, the Tiempo, Mercurial, Phantom and The Premier, functioning as a subdivision of the previously mentioned catalog. Finally, we find the shopping cart when it is empty, but also when it has an item inside.



## Steps to view the site


In our default terminal, we clone the folder by typing "git clone" + link:

1- git clone https://github.com/Jcruzcorti/nikestore

2- Then, we place ourselves in the root folder of the project, with the command "cd NIKESTORE" and install all the dependencies that are inside with the command "npm install".

3-Finally, in the terminal we carry out the command "npm start" and the web site will open in the predetermined browser after a few seconds/minutes of waiting.
